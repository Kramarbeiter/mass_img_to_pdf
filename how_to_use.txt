skript scans all pictures in subfolders of "img_to_pdf" (1.) and converts them into a single pdf per subfolder. pdf name will be the same as name of containing subfolder. also works if folders are zipped. source data will be deleted after conversion is complete.

1. create folder "img_to_pdf" in downloads an copy all zips and folders containing pictures to be converted in said folder
2. copy and paste mass_img_tp_pdf.py in downloads (if using for first time, open file and set correct path name at the end)
3. run cmd
4. type "cd downloads"
5. type "py mass_img_to_pdf.py"
